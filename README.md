- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @alexhayneshs
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a **Senior Front-End Developer** at Help Scout
- ðŸ¦‰ I'm currently pursuing a B.S. of Mathematics at Indiana University East. (My first B.A. was in French Literature!)
- ðŸ¤” I think often about UI and how it can be improved, how user experience can be made more intuitive and more delightful, and how to balance practicality and whimsy on the web 
- ðŸŒ² When I'm not in VS Code, I like to hike through regional forests, take long walks in town, explore city parks and rural trails, and learn new things
