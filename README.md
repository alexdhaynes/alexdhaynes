- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @alexdhaynes
- ğŸ¦‰ I'm currently pursuing a B.S. of Mathematics at Indiana University East. (My first B.A. was in French Literature at NYU)
- ğŸŒ² When I'm not in VS Code, I like to hike through regional forests, take long walks in town, explore city parks and rural trails, and learn new things
